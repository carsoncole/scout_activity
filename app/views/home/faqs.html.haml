        .question How can I reset the votes?
        .answer
          To remove votes, the Administrator of the Unit should set the votes allowed
          to `0`, which will remove all votes (the system will remove any user excess votes as you reduce the number). Once the votes have been removed, the votes allowed can be set to any number.
