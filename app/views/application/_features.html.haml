      %p The annual challenge for planning Scout activities is a ritual all Troops go through. ScoutActivity makes it easy to offer one place that your Troop's Scouts, leaders, parents and other volunteers can offer up ideas that bring excitement, new adventures, and new opportunities for learning to your Scouts. And on the site, Scouts can vote for the ideas that excite them the most, engaging them in the planning process.

      %p The site makes it easy to highlight exciting ideas and informing new Scouts about how exciting an activity has been in the past. Activities can be written up to include Troop photos, maps, an itinerary, and a lot more details that will inspire your Scouts to want to do it, and ultimately do it.

      %p The site makes it easy for voting on activities. Each Scout is given a set number of votes that can be apportioned over all of the activities, or just on their most favorite choices. This will make it easy for your PLC to review and see where the Troop has the highest interest and can plan accordingly.

      %p By encouraging parents and other volunteers to propose ideas to the Troop, you also open the door for their involvement in helping prepare for and hold the activity. For example, one of your parents could be a professional bicyclist and could offer a weekend-long bike trips, and in preparation, could help Scouts to not only holding the event, but even hosting bike clinics leading up the event. It's an easier route to getting more volunteers!
